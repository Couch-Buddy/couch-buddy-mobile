# Couch Buddy mobile app

Mobile app for [Couch Buddy media center](https://github.com/lucafaggianelli/couch-buddy).

This is a regular Flutter app, so it can be built for Android and iOS.

> **Please notice**: `chromecast_api` plugin for Flutter doesn't support iOS, yet. So the iOS app will not have cast support.

The app works in couple with the Couch Buddy server, so be sure to run it and set your server IP
address together with the port number, in the app settings, i.e. `http://192.168.1.23:3000`.
